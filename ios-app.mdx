Our bread and butter. This is where NOSSAFLEX began, and you can [download the app today.](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/nossaflex/id1523558285)
While we're actively working on expanding to Android to make it accessible to even more people,
you can follow our progress by [joining the conversation on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/wMrKxED).


The app brings the The [NOSSAFLEX System to life](nossaflex-system), allowing you to log your film camera settings 
along with descriptions, locations, and photo references, using our custom-built light meter. 
It’s a valuable tool for self-learning, helping you analyze patterns in your settings. Do you 
gravitate toward certain styles? What are your go-to settings? How do your reference photos 
compare to the final scans? It’s all about insight and growth.
