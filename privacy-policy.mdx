This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how NOSSAFLEX Pty Ltd (ACN: 641 467 736 ("Website Operator", "we", "us" or "our")) collects, protects and uses the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide on the nossaflex.io website and any of its products or services (collectively, "Website" or "Services").
It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

## A word on our iOS app
In plain English, this is front and centre so you are aware of how your information is collected and used. Using our iOS app ‘NOSSAFLEX’ means you have agreed to the terms in this policy.
We are using Google Services to collect and store your data–specifically Firebase. The core information collected is: Camera metadata (nossaflex data), cameras, date created, location, descriptions, name and email. We cannot see your password, we cannot see your reference images. The reference images feature stores the photos locally on your device, they are as secure as the Apple iOS ecosystem and cannot be seen by us.

**_Most apps will store all of this data locally, so why are we collecting it on a database? Why do you need an account to use our app?_**

We are trying to create more than an app, we are trying to create a collection of tools that work with each other. The information that is stored on the database will be able to be accessed from:
* Any other phone you log in from (including Android when it releases)
* Our Web App that is being created.

The Web App is going to display your data for you so it can be searched and organised. Without a database to connect the mobile apps to the web app this could not be possible. Some users may not like this but it is unfortunately the direction we have decided to best suit the tools we’re trying to create. If you do not agree with us, please do not use our app as the information above will be collected in the database.

## Automatic collection of information
When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.
Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

## Collection of personal information
You can visit the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the Website's features, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your name and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any online forms on the Website. When required, this information may include the following:
- Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.
- Contact information such as email address, address, etc.
You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Website's features. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to contact us.

## Use and processing of collected information
In order to make our Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Some of the information we collect is directly from you via our Website. However, we may also collect Personal Information about you from other sources. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:
Send administrative information
* Request user feedback
* Protect from abuse and malicious users
* Respond to legal requests and prevent harm
* Run and operate our Website and Services

Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with our Website, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.

**_Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract._**

## Disclosure of information
Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to you.

We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information.

## Retention of information

We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period. As an Australian company, we generally keep records of information for an average of 7 years. If you wish to be completely erased from our records please get in contact via the email at the bottom of this policy.
