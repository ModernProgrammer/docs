title: 'How does the NOSSAFLEX System work?'
---

It’s as straightforward as the name suggests—NOSSAFLEX puts everything you need in the title.
> * **NO = Number**
> * **SS = Shutter Speed**
> * **A = Aperture**
> * **FL = Focal Length**
> * **EX = Exposure**

Just note these down in this order and use them to rename your film scans. Each time you look at your photos, you’ll instantly know your settings. It’s an easy way to organize and learn from your shots. Ever rediscovered a photo and been amazed you could handhold at 1/15th of a second? NOSSAFLEX helps you track these details.

### Examples in Action
Here are some examples of how the system works when applied to your file names:

<div class="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/RN004_NO03_SS250_A8_FL80_EX0_E.jpeg" alt="RN004_NO03_SS250_A8_FL80_EX0.jpeg"  />
    **RN004_NO03_SS250_A8_FL80_EX0.jpeg**

    <p>This references Roll Number 004, Shot Number 03, Shutter Speed 1/250, Aperture f/8, Focal Length 80mm, and neutral Exposure.</p>
</div>

    <img src="/images/RN004_NO06_SS10s_A22_FL80_EX0_E.jpeg" alt="RN004_NO06_SS10s_A22_FL80_EX0.jpeg" />
    **RN004_NO06_SS10s_A22_FL80_EX0.jpeg**

    In this case, Shutter Speed is 10 seconds, with Aperture f/22, Focal Length 80mm, and neutral Exposure.

    <img src="/images/RN007_NO34_SS30_A2.8_FL35_EX0_E.jpeg" alt="RN007_NO34_SS30_A2.8_FL35_EX+1.jpeg"  />
    **RN007_NO34_SS30_A2.8_FL35_EX+1.jpeg**

    Here, the Exposure is set at +1, showing a deliberate choice to overexpose based on the light meter reading.

### Where’s My Film Stock Info?
You’ll want to store your film scans somewhere, right? That’s where folders come in. We label our folders like this:

**“Roll 006 – Portra 400 @ 200 (135) – Nikon F6”**
* **Roll Number** (e.g., Roll 006)
* **Film Stock** (Portra 400) and the rated ISO (e.g., @ 200)
* **Film Size**  (135)
* **Camera Used** (Nikon F6)

This folder naming system keeps track of everything you didn’t put in the file name. But feel free to tweak it—maybe you prefer adding the date, location, or multiple cameras for double exposures. Make it your own!

### Spicy Tips
* To avoid duplicate file names, add 
* For point-and-shoot cameras, where values are set automatically, use **SSauto** and **Aauto** for Shutter Speed and Aperture.
* For longer exposures, just add an **'s'** -for example, **6s** for a 6-second exposure.
